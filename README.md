# moniker

To use you need to download a chromedriver and selenium installed. It works on windows, no sure about other OS.

This is to everyone who wants to read some turma da monikers jovem comics. I didn't host those files.

The ```pdf2cbz``` function was heavily inspired on [Ishydo's](https://github.com/Ishydo/PDF2CBZ) implementation. 

### TODO:
- [ ] GUI (?)
- [ ] integration with KCC (don't know if its possible)
- [ ] maybe some kindle email stuff 

I don't know if this is legal, but i don't mind.
